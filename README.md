# Test for cloning

Always remember, clones are people two.

## Instructions
The objective of this test is to clone a repo on the RStudio server or your
own machine and push some minor changes back to github. Clone this repository, 
answer question 1, and push your changes back to github. See the github notes
on creating a new project from "Version Control" that I posted in Week One.

### Question 1
Have you ever used Git, SVN, or another revision control system before? 

### Answer 1
